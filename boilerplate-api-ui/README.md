# boilerplate-api-ui

This project builds a documentation web application for the CAF Audit Management Web Service. It allows users to see what operations the web service exposes as well as documentation relating to those operations and the web service in general.

The war generated by this project is built into the docker image in [boilerplate-api-container](https://github.com/CAFDataProcessing/boilerplate-service/tree/develop/boilerplate-api-container).

##Usage

To get started, deploy the [web service docker container](https://github.com/CAFDataProcessing/boilerplate-service/tree/develop/boilerplate-api-container). The web service UI can then be accessed at the following URL:

	http://<docker.ip.address>:<port>/boilerplate-api-ui

Replace `<docker.ip.address>` and `<port>` as necessary.
