I found this article on using subtrees instead of submodules, not sure
if it is of use but thought I would share anyway:

We can try it but my gut feeling is that it that would be complex to
manage and actually cause more confusion than it solves – because (1) it
will make it look like the projects are missing if you don’t use a
particular git clone option, and (2) any updates make when you browse
through to the sub-module will not automatically appear when you browse
again because the main projects is still linked to a particular earlier
commit.
